    * Data preparation and cleaning with pandas
    * Data visualization with Matplotlib
    * Geographic plotting with Folium
  * SQL/Python Jupyter Notebook [Major League Baseball Salary](https://github.com/FlorianBreut/FB-Portfolio/blob/master/Traffic%20Acccidents%20in%20Denver.ipynb)
    * SQL data manipulation and analysis
    * Data Correlation matrix analysis with seaborn
    * Prediction of player salary using Scikit Learn regression functions
* A [SLAM algorithm for Autonomous Vehicle](https://github.com/FlorianBreut/FB-Portfolio/blob/master/SLAM%20EKF%20FB.pdf) 
  * Based on Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). 
  * LIDAR and Ultrasonic sensor noise simulated
  * This prototype algorithm was developed with Matlab and V-rep Robot simulation.
* A C++ optimal algorithm for [3d water level](https://github.com/FlorianBreut/FB-Portfolio/tree/master/WaterVolume) computation
  * Implementation of Binary Heap Priority queue without using stl
  * Implementation of Dijkstra algorithm variant
* A C++11 [multi-thread Computer Vision library](https://github.com/FlorianBreut/FB-Portfolio/tree/master/cv_rotate_img_lib) skeleton for Robotics applications :
  * Implementation of Nearest neighbour rotation algorithm
  * can rotate NxP pixels images with *.jpg *.jpeg *.jpe *.png *.bmp *.dib *.sr *.ras *.tiff *.tif  extensions
  * The algorithm compile with g++ in a linux environment
