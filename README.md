    * Data preparation and cleaning with pandas
    * Data visualization with Matplotlib
    * Geographic plotting with Folium
  * [Major League Baseball Salary SQL/Python Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/FlorianBreut/FB-Portfolio/blob/master/Traffic%20Acccidents%20in%20Denver.ipynb)
    * SQL data manipulation and analysis
    * Data Correlation matrix analysis with seaborn
    * Prediction of player salary using Scikit Learn regression functions
* A [Simulaneous Localization and Mapping algorithm](https://github.com/FlorianBreut/FB-Portfolio/blob/master/SLAM%20EKF%20FB.pdf) (SLAM) based on Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for an Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV). This prototype algorithm was developed in Matlab environment and V-rep Robot simulation.
